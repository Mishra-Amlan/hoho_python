Flow 1: Dashboard (Landing Page) Purpose: Central hub for accessing audit insights, reports, and analytics. Features: Overview of audit scores across regions and timeframes. Filters by industry, location, auditor, and date. Visualizations: heatmaps, trend graphs, score distributions. Alerts for low-performing outlets or non-compliance. Discussion Points: Should support role-based access (e.g., regional manager vs. central QA team). Option to export data and reports. ðŸ”¹ Flow 2: Report Ingestion Purpose: Upload and process unstructured audit reports. Features: Upload interface for PDFs, Word docs, emails. Drag-and-drop or bulk upload. OCR and NLP pipeline to extract text. Metadata tagging (location, date, auditor name). Discussion Points: Support for multilingual reports. Auto-detection of report format and structure. ðŸ”¹ Flow 3: NLP & Generative AI Processing Purpose: Interpret free-text audit content using AI. Features: Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key parameters (e.g., cleanliness, SOP adherence). Sentiment analysis and contextual scoring. Generative AI to summarize findings per parameter. Confidence scores for AI-generated evaluations. Discussion Points: Fine-tuning models on industry-specific audit language. Human-in-the-loop validation for edge cases. ðŸ”¹ Flow 4: Parameter-wise Scoring Purpose: Generate structured scores from unstructured text. Features: Scorecards for each audit parameter. Weighting logic based on audit guidelines. Comparison with historical scores. Highlighting anomalies or missing data. Discussion Points: Customizable scoring rubrics per industry. Option to override AI scores manually. ðŸ”¹ Flow 5: Audit Summary & Recommendations Purpose: Provide actionable insights and next steps. Features: Auto-generated summary of audit findings. Recommendations for improvement. Risk flags and compliance alerts. Link to SOP documents or training modules. Discussion Points: Integration with internal knowledge bases. Feedback loop for auditors to improve future reports. ðŸ”¹ Flow 6: Admin & Configuration Panel Purpose: Manage system settings and audit parameters. Features: Define audit parameters and scoring logic. Manage user roles and permissions. Upload SOPs and branding guidelines. Configure AI model thresholds and retraining schedules. Discussion Points: Audit trail for changes. Version control for scoring rubrics. ðŸ”¹ Flow 7: Feedback & Continuous Learning Purpose: Improve AI accuracy over time. Features: Interface for users to correct AI interpretations. Retraining pipeline using corrected data. Performance dashboard for AI accuracy. Discussion Points: Gamification for auditor engagement. Metrics for model drift and retraining needs.
