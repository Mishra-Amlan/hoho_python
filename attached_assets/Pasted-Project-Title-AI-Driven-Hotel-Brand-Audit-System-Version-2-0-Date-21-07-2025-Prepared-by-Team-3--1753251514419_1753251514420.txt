Project Title: AI-Driven Hotel Brand Audit System Version: 2.0 Date: 21/07/2025 Prepared by: Team-3 Ritesh Kumar Khandelwal Amlan Mishra Harsh Singh Sayandip Mahato Stakeholders: - Brand Experience Team - Field Auditors - Audit Operations Team - Compliance Team - IT/AI Innovation Team 1. Executive Summary The initiative focuses on automating hotel brand audits by leveraging AI technology to analyze diverse inputs such as photos, videos, and text-based checklists. Outputs include detailed reports on facilities, identification of gaps and non-compliance issues, scored checklist items, and compliance zone categorizations to drive operational improvements. 2. Goals and Objectives High-Level Goals: - Enable automated evaluation of audits to diminish manual processing times. - Ensure scoring consistency across evaluations to facilitate equitable compliance tracking. - Provide rapid, actionable insights through report generation. - Classify hotel compliance levels into zones with distinct labels: Red, Amber, Green. Low-Level Objectives: - Utilize AI models to process multi-format inputs, ensuring accuracy above 85%. - Achieve scalability capable of handling up to 500 audits per day. - Ensure encryption at rest and in transit to maintain data security. 3. Scope of the Use Case In-Scope: - Multi-format input acceptance (photos, videos, and checklists). - AI analysis of visual and text content for facilities audit. - Scoring and zone classification based on compliance parameters with predefined labels. Out-of-Scope: - Development of real-time dashboards or intricate analytics tools beyond basic reporting. 4. Functional Requirements High-Level Functional Requirements: - FR1: Support image and video processing via integrated capture tools or APIs. - FR2: Include voice-note-to-text conversion for supplementary evidence collection. - FR3: Generate thorough reports detailing operational insights and compliance status. Low-Level Functional Requirements: - FR4: Employ NLP and sentiment analysis for detailed checklist evaluations. - FR5: AI-driven tagging to identify non-compliance and recommend Corrective Action Plans (CAPs). - FR6: Produce downloadable reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel) for extensive stakeholder review. 5. Non-Functional Requirements High-Level Non-Functional Requirements: - NFR1: At least 85% accuracy in evaluations to ensure credibility. - NFR2: Maximize processing performance, delivering reports in under 2 minutes. Low-Level Non-Functional Requirements: - NFR3: Adherence to GDPR-compliant data practices, including anonymized audit data. - NFR4: Ensure robust security measures for compliance with privacy laws. 6. Sample Audit Parameters Category: Facilities and Operations - Parameters: - Cleanliness & Hygiene: Cleanliness standards, staff hygiene, sanitization practices. - Branding Compliance: Visual adherence to branding, uniform compliance. - Operational Efficiency: SOP adherence, service delivery standards. Category: Compliance - Parameters: - Regulatory Compliance: Display licenses, fire exit accessibility, safety protocol adherence. 7. User Roles and Responsibilities High-Level Roles: - Mystery Guest Auditor (Vendor): Conducts audits, records observations, submits draft reports. - Final Reviewer (QA Vendor): Validates AI-generated drafts, submits finalized reports to IHCL. Low-Level Responsibilities: - Audit Oversight Reviewer: Conducts spot checks, reviews consistency. - L&D/Operations Team: Uses audit insights for training refinements. 8. Technology Considerations High-Level Components: - AI Model Technological Stack (Gemini Flash 2.0) - Multi-language support for accessibility Low-Level Technologies: - APIs (PDF, Image/Video recognition, language processing) - Secure storage for outputs and report data 9. Success Criteria - Evaluation Accuracy: Maintain system accuracy above 85%. - Audit Processing Speed: Ensure reports are generated within 2 minutes. - Corrective Action Plans: Suggest templates based on audit findings. 10. Risks and Mitigation - Compliance Risks: Implement GDPR-compliant audit trails. - Data Misinterpretation: Enhance AI model training for comprehensive coverage. 11.
