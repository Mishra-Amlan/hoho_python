1. Executive Summary
The initiative focuses on automating hotel brand audits by leveraging AI technology to 
analyze diverse inputs such as photos, videos, and text-based checklists. Outputs include 
detailed reports on facilities, identification of gaps and non-compliance issues, scored 
checklist items, and compliance zone categorizations to drive operational improvements.
2. Goals and Objectives
High-Level Goals:
- Enable automated evaluation of audits to diminish manual processing times.
- Ensure scoring consistency across evaluations to facilitate equitable compliance 
tracking.
- Provide rapid, actionable insights through report generation.
- Classify hotel compliance levels into zones with distinct labels: Red, Amber, Green.
Low-Level Objectives:
- Utilize AI models to process multi-format inputs, ensuring accuracy above 85%.
- Achieve scalability capable of handling up to 500 audits per day.
- Ensure encryption at rest and in transit to maintain data security.
3. Scope of the Use Case
In-Scope:
- Multi-format input acceptance (photos, videos, and checklists).
- AI analysis of visual and text content for facilities audit.
- Scoring and zone classification based on compliance parameters with predefined labels.
Out-of-Scope:
- Development of real-time dashboards or intricate analytics tools beyond basic reporting.
4. Functional Requirements
High-Level Functional Requirements:
- FR1: Support image and video processing via integrated capture tools or APIs.
- FR2: Include voice-note-to-text conversion for supplementary evidence collection.
- FR3: Generate thorough reports detailing operational insights and compliance status.
Low-Level Functional Requirements:
- FR4: Employ NLP and sentiment analysis for detailed checklist evaluations.
- FR5: AI-driven tagging to identify non-compliance and recommend Corrective Action 
Plans (CAPs).
- FR6: Produce downloadable reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel) for extensive 
stakeholder review.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
High-Level Non-Functional Requirements:
- NFR1: At least 85% accuracy in evaluations to ensure credibility.
- NFR2: Maximize processing performance, delivering reports in under 2 minutes.
Low-Level Non-Functional Requirements:
- NFR3: Adherence to GDPR-compliant data practices, including anonymized audit data.
- NFR4: Ensure robust security measures for compliance with privacy laws.
